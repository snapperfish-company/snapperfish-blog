The evenings are pretty lively in Chiang Mai, especially if you arrive for the weekend.
The _Old Town_ streets open up on Saturday's and Sunday's for Walking Markets that have everything
from food to clothes and trinkets. 

It pays to get to the Walking Markets early 
as Lisa and I discovered during our visit. 
We found that it was best to get to go to the Walking Markets between <time>6</time> and <time>7pm</time>.

This gave us plenty of time to absorb the atmosphere before 
joining the growing crowds in the heart of the market.

We mostly went to the Walking Markets for the food, 
and found by the time we got round we had helped ourselves to a 3 course meal.

There are some tasty rewards, if you are OK with the crowds!

They have food that will cater for most dietry requirements.

And the snacks to munch on while looking around the stalls aren't half bad either!

Lisa was especially successful on one of the nights 
and impressesd me with her natural talent for batering 
her herself a dress and bracelet for a bargin price.
