## PROLOGUE: Bangkok roads are hazardous to your health

It wasn't long after exiting our hostel _Tims House_ on Maha Chai Road for the first time 
that we realised we had been dealt our first challange.

You see the road system works quite differently from what I have come to expect in the UK. 
Despite there being an abundance of pelican crossings in the City, in contrast to the UK 
a red light for the cars and scooters doesn't mean that they will stop for you. 

And yet peel away at the layers of perseved anarchy and you will find a system, or what can be more 
accuratly described as a _gentlemens agreement_ between predestrian and driver.

Should you become bold enough to walk in front of them, 
they _will_ stop for you... or at the very least drive around you as you walk across the road.

> PRO TIP: Use the locals as human shields when crossing the road

## The Giant Swing

After becoming aquanted with the road system in Bangkok, 
we started walking in the rough direction of _Wat Pho_.

It wasn't long into our walk before Lisa and I stumbled upon our first photo opportunity, 
the _Giant Swing_ on Bamrung Muang Road.

As the name suggests, this was infact a giant swing constructed in 1784, 
the swing as been reconstructed several times, 
but sadly this giant beast swung it's last in the 1930's due to a number of fatal accidents. 

## Grand Palace surroundings

It wasn't long after the Giant Swing before we reached the outskirts of the _Grand Palace_, 
the grounds are vast and there is plenty to see and do without paying to go into the palace grounds itself.

Take this roundabout of Pink Elephants for example.

Or Lak Mueang, the city pillars shrine.

And wall art dedicated to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

## Wat Pho and the Reclining Buddha

The real gem beyond the Grand Palace is Wat Pho, the home of the Reclining Buddha.
At 1/5 th of the price (100 baht per person) of the Grand Palace, Wat Pho is serious value for money.

The extended grounds of Wat Pho contain the largest collection of Buddha images in Thailand,
it is vast and can easily provide a couple of hours entertainment 
for those that like to walk round at a leisurely pace.

The star of the show though is of course the Reclining Buddha, the buddha lies at 46 metres long and 
it became quite the struggle to position myself for a decent photo because of the crowds.
Determination paid off in the end and I was able to get a couple of good ones including one of Lisa below.

Needless to say we both left Wat Pho in high spirits enjoying our first experience 
of what Bangkok had to offer!
