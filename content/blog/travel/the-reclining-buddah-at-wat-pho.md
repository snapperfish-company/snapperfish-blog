# PROLOGUE: Bangkok roads are hazardous to your health

It wasn't long after exiting the hotel on [road name] for the first time 
that we realised we had been dealt our first challange.

You see the roads work quite differently from what we have come to expect in the UK. 
Despite there being an abundance of pelican crossings in the City, in contrast to the UK 
a red light for the cars and scooters doesn't mean that they will stop for you. 

And yet peel away at the layers of perseved anarchy and you will find a system, or what can be more 
accuratly described as a _gentlemens agreement_ between predestrian and driver.

Should you become bold enough to walk in front of them, 
they _will_ stop for you... or at the very least drive around you as you walk across the road.

> PRO TIP: Use a local as a human shield when you are crossing

# On route to _Wat Arun_

After becoming aquanted with the road system in Bangkok, 
we started walking in the rough direction of _Wat Arun_.

It didn't take us long before Lisa and I found our first photo opportunity, the _giant swing_ at [roundabout name].
How you are supposed to swing on it is quite beyond me (sobre).

Bangkok is a sightseers wet dream should always be armed with his camera when treversing the City.

The Reclining Buddah is a seriously good sight, I quickly discovered others agreed with me
me I struggled to position myself because of the mass of people but nudging
