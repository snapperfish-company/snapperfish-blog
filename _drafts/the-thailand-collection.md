# Getting there

...

We had arrived...

# Bangkok roads are hazardous to your health
 
It wasn't long after exiting the hotel for the first time 
that we realised we had been dealt our first challange.

You see the roads work quite differently from what we have come to expect in the UK. 
Despite there being an abundance of pelican crossings in the City, in contrast to the UK 
a red light for the cars and scooters doesn't mean that they will stop for you. 

And yet peel away at the layers of perseved anarchy and you will find a system, or what can be more 
accuratly described as a _gentlemens agreement_ between predestrian and driver.

Should you become bold enough to walk in front of them, 
they _will_ stop for you... or at the very least drive around you as you walk across the road.

Possible edit:

After weighing up our options for the best part of 5 minutes 
and sheepishly observing others from the roadside, we grew the courage to try and cross for ourselves. 

Pro Tip: Use the locals as human shields
